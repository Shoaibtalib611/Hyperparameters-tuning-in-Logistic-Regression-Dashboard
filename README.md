# Hyperparameters-tuning-in-Logistic-Regression-Dashboard
A Dashboard in python using Streamlit and plotly about hyperparameters tuning in Logistic-Regression. I have used two built-in datasets in seaborn. Tips dataset is for binary classification and iris dataset for Multiclass Classification. Hyperparameters can be tuned and accuracy can be checked accordingly
To run the file use the command (streamlit run multinomial.py)
